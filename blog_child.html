            <p>Welcome to Meeple 4 People Cafe, a board game Cafe that caters to everyone 
                who is 14 years and older. We're so happy that we get to share in this grand 
                opening with all of you and be a part of your community! We are located in 
                Downtown Vancouver, so we are transit accessible and easy to reach. Our new 
                facility is 4000 Sq feet and filled with new board games just waiting for you to play!
            </p>

            <img class="main_img" src="img/blog_1_open.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="blog1image">

            <p>You don’t need to worry about those runaway game pieces because our tables are 
                custom made with built-in containers to keep your game pieces exactly where you 
                want them. We’ve loaded up with comfortable chairs for all our guests to enjoy. 
                We also have a small in-house café where guests can buy snack foods, drinks, and 
                light meals.
            </p>
            <p>When you get the munchies come by the Cafe. Whether you're hungry for a light meal 
                such as a wrap or sandwich and salad or wanting to get something to share with 
                everyone on the table we have something that will suit your needs! We also sell 
                popular candies by the bowl so you can share with friends and family. Order a bowl 
                of spicy cinnamon hearts for the table on Valentine’s Day and get a small complimentary 
                bowl of popcorn for free!
            </p>
            <p>We also carry a range of specialty Asian snacks such as Cup Noodles (kimchi noodles 
                anyone?), Pocky, crunchy mamee noodles, hamburger candies, Japanese Candies, and 
                other snacks like honey twists and many more. If you want the classic snacks, we’ve 
                got those too from chips to cookies, you’ll be able to satisfy any craving!
            </p>
            <p>When you walk into the cafe, the first thing you will notice is the welcoming and 
                spacious interior. You will be greeted by our friendly staff who will direct you to 
                where you want to go. If you decide to go to the café section, you will see our large 
                wall menu. The display case of the available snacks to purchase is easy to find so you
                can grab a quick snack in between game rounds. You’ll need fuel to play your best 
                against your opponents!
            </p>
            <p>If you are ready to play, you can come to our counter where you can purchase a game 
                ticket. We recommend the pricing package of $12 for 3 hours of gameplay. You will
                have enough time to enjoy your game, even if it runs overtime. If you do run out 
                of time, not to worry! It’s only $2 per hour after the 3 hours.
            </p>
            <p>After you purchase a game ticket, you are free to play by joining an existing table,
                starting your own table, or just setting up your game on our spacious floor. Our
                employees will come by to offer assistance. They would be happy to help you order 
                food or assist with teaching you how to play a new game. If you need help do not 
                hesitate to call someone over!
            </p>
            <p>When you're in the Meeple 4 People Cafe be sure to check out the events wall to see
                a list of our new and upcoming events. We welcome all ideas so do let us know if
                you have any suggestions or requests and we will try to accommodate.
            </p>
            <p>For our guests who prefer a well-lit gaming area, we have desk lighting on the 
                table in case you feel like you need a brighter table for games that have smaller 
                pieces. Feel free to leave the desk light off if you prefer a cozier atmosphere as well.
            </p>
            <p>Be sure to visit us on February 10th for our Grand Opening! We’ll have discounts 
                for students and promotions to start your fun times in our new space!
            </p>
            <p>We just have a few house rules to keep everyone safe and happy in our café. 
                Our code of conduct is that when you enter our facility, we are an inclusive facility
                that welcomes people of all creeds, genders, and walks of life. Our house rules are 
                that you play responsibly and respect others whether you win or lose. Winning is a 
                part of life and so is losing and we ask that you do not use inappropriate language 
                in the Cafe.
            </p>

            <h3>Here are some tips on how to use our cafe:</h3>
                <ul id="bullet">
                    <li>Visit the welcome table to purchase a ticket to start playing</li>
                    <li>Visit our Cafe to purchase food and drinks if you get hungry</li>
                    <li>We have washrooms in the store if you need to use them</li>
                    <li>Make sure you take breaks and enjoy yourself</li>
                    <li>Above all have fun</li>
                </ul>

            <p>You don’t need to be a professional at board games to play. Everyone's a winner 
                as long as they are having fun!
            </p>

            <p>Our hours of operation are 10AM to 9PM on Monday-Thursday, and 10AM to 12AM 
                on Friday-Sunday . We have coat racks placed around the room so you can play 
                without the bulk of a large winter coat. We can’t wait for you to try out our
                newly renovated facility and try out all these features for yourself!
