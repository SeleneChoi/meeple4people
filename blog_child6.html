            <h2>1. Terraforming Mars</h2>
            <p>Terraforming Mars is a popular board game that has been around for a while, but we still think it’s one of the best games to play this month. In this board game, players compete to terraform the planet Mars by raising the temperature, oxygen, and ocean levels. Players must use cards to build infrastructure, plant forests, and create oceans to make the planet habitable. The game is played over several rounds, and the player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins. The game is perfect for players who enjoy strategy games with a science-fiction theme. There are six types of resources available for players to track: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. Players need to also keep track of global parameters such as temperature, oxygen, and ocean. In the end, you will count your Terraform Rating and victory points to see who won!

            <h2>3. Oath</h2>
            <p>Oath is a new board game that's perfect for players who enjoy games with a fantasy theme. In this game, players compete to become the ruler of a kingdom, with each player taking on a different role. Players must use cards and tokens to build influence, claim territory, and gain supporters. However, the game is not just about accumulating power; players must also make alliances, deal with changing political landscapes, and make promises that they may not be able to keep.

            <h2>4. Tiny Towns</h2>
            <p>Tiny Towns is a simple but addictive board game that's perfect for players who enjoy city-building games. In this game, players take turns placing building blocks on a 4x4 grid. Each block represents a different building, such as a farm, tavern, or bakery. Players must strategically place the blocks to create patterns that will earn them victory points. However, players must also be careful not to overbuild, as they may run out of space. The game is played over several rounds, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
