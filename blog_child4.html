            <p>Life can get stressful and busy. It can be hard to meet people and make new friends. We understand that! Also, in a city of over 600,000 people it is easy to feel a bit lost. Don’t get lost in the shuffle! Whether you are new in town or just looking for some like-minded people to hang out with, our Meep Up event is the perfect venue for you!</p>

            <p>At the Meep Up Event you will have the chance to meet board gamers who are passionate about playing, collecting, trading, buying, and of course playing board games. </p>
            
            <p>We encourage all our guests to take some time to chat and get to know others in your community before beginning a friendly or competitive, whatever your gaming styles, board game. If anyone needs help our staff are always available to show you how to play the games.</p>
             
            <p>No prior experience is required, and we want everyone to visit and enjoy a night of fun! Our café is built for a crowd. Whether you are enjoying a board game at one of our custom-built tables, or satisfying a craving at our convenient concession stand, you’re sure to have a good time.</p>
             
            <h2>Meeple 4 People’s Film Finds Friday</h2>
             
            <p>Next week we will be hosting our Film Finds Friday! Come down to the café and enjoy a movie theme inspired game night with us! Some people host movie nights, and some people have game nights, but why not combine the best of both worlds and have a movie game night? We will have themed games from some fan favourite movies like Ozark, Squid Games, Lord of the Rings, Jumanji, Doctor Who, and many more!</p>
             
            <p>There will be no spoilers at this event, just a guaranteed good time! We encourage all our guests to take advantage of the comfortable seating in our café and grab a snack and drink from our concession stand.</p>
             
            <p>We’ll be featuring theatre themed snacks like popcorn, candy, and chips! Don’t forget the giant sodas too!</p>
            Not only will we have tables that will be able to seat 12 per table, we’ll also be bringing in beanbags, couches, and extra foldable tables so that everyone can join in the fun no matter where you are in the café. In addition to the extra seating for board gamers, we have brought in multiple couches to create a theatre in the back of the café! Now you can watch a movie and play the board game featuring that movie at the same time!
             
            <p>At the event, we will also have prizes up for grabs! Enter your name at the front of the café to be automatically entered into our lucky draw at the end of the day. Our other prizes include a brand new Quacks of Quedlinburg boardgame which can be won by the winner of our board game trivia game!</p>
             

            <h3>Some basic rules:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Please give all participants an equal turn to try out a board game</li>
                <li>Have fun!</li>
                <li>Feel free to bring your own board games to play, or try some of ours!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We love our movie-based board games because they offer an immersive and interactive way to enjoy favorite films and TV shows. These games let players step into the roles of their favorite characters, play out iconic scenes, and engage in thrilling adventures. They also often come with detailed miniatures, game boards, and cards that feature characters, locations, and events from the source material. These games are theme based which means there are elements from the movies that are customized and replicated in the games. Players will recognize themes from the movies or files which will add an extra layer of excitement and immersion. Movie-based board games are a fantastic way to extend the entertainment value of a beloved franchise and offer a fun and engaging experience for both casual and hardcore gamers alike.</p>
            
            <p>Nothing makes us happier than seeing happy smiles on our guest’s faces! Come in today and enjoy these movie themed board games with us!</p>
             
            <p>Also, don’t forget to sign up for our monthly newsletters to be the first to find out about the latest events and promotions!</p>
