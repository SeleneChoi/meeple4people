            <p>Board games are a great way to spend quality time with friends and family. They bring people together and can provide hours of entertainment. However, like any other items, board games can wear out over time if they are not properly maintained. In this blog post, we will share some tips and tricks for maintaining board games so that they can be enjoyed for years to come.
            </p>

            <img class="main_img" src="img/blog_7_clean.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="blog7image">

            <h2>1. Store them properly</h2>
            <p>The first step in maintaining board games is to store them properly. Board games should be stored in a cool dry place, away from direct sunlight. This will prevent the game components from warping, fading or becoming discolored. It is also important to store board games vertically, rather than stacking them horizontally. This will prevent the boxes from becoming crushed or damaged.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Keep them clean</h2>
            <p>Keeping board games clean is essential for maintaining their longevity. Regularly wipe down the game components with a dry cloth to remove any dust or debris. If there are any spills or stains, wipe them up immediately to prevent them from setting into the game board or pieces. Avoid using any harsh cleaning products, as they may damage the game components.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Handle them with care</h2>
            <p>Board games are meant to be played, but it is important to handle them with care. Rough handling can cause game pieces to break or become lost, and can also damage the game board. When setting up a game, be gentle when handling the game components. If a game piece does become damaged or lost, try to replace it with a similar piece to maintain the integrity of the game.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Use protective sleeves</h2>
            <p>Some board games come with cards that are used frequently throughout the game. Over time, these cards can become worn or damaged. To prevent this, use protective sleeves to cover the cards. These sleeves are available in various sizes and can be found at most gaming stores. A bonus is that they not only protect the cards, but also make shuffling easier.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Avoid exposing them to moisture</h2>
            <p>Moisture is a board game's worst enemy. Exposure to moisture can cause game components to warp or become discolored, and can also lead to the growth of mold and mildew. To avoid this, keep board games away from areas with high humidity, such as basements or bathrooms. If a game does become exposed to moisture, immediately remove the game components from the box and lay them out to dry. Do not stack the game components until they are completely dry.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Be mindful of the game's age</h2>
            <p>Some board games are designed to be played for many years, while others may only be intended for a few plays. Be mindful of the age of the game, and adjust your maintenance routine accordingly. Games that are meant to be played for many years may require more frequent cleaning and storage measures than games that are intended for a few plays.
            </p>

            <p>To ensure that your games last for years to come, it is important to store them properly, keep them clean, handle them with care, use protective sleeves, and avoid exposing them to moisture, and be aware of the age of the board game. By following these simple tips, you can keep your games in great condition and enjoy them for many years to come.
