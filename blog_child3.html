            <p>At Meeple 4 People, not all fun and games are just on a board. 
                Last weekend our Scavenger Quest event was a huge success! Scavenger 
                Shuffle is an event where customers can participate in a scavenger hunt 
                held in store.  

            </p>
            <p>When customers walk into out café and wish to join the hunt, they receive 
                a miniature “scroll.” they must find M4P’s logo in 10 different areas with 
                2 bonus logos. Once the scroll is received, participants have 1 hour to find 
                all the hidden logos within the store! 
            </p>
            <h2>Bonus 2 Logos Riddle:</h2>
            <h3>1. I can be full or empty, come in all shapes and sizes, and always have a handle, 
                what am I?</h3>
            <h3>2.I'm often stacked high with food, yet I'm not a shelf, what am I?</h3>
            <img class="main_img" src="img/scroll.png" style="width:50%" alt="scroll">
            <p>All those who have successfully completed the Scavenger Quest win a free 1-hour 
                admission for our café that can be used within the next month. For those who 
                found all the logos including the 2 bonuses, will have a chance to win more 
                prizes such as a M4P gift card, a drink & food combo coupon, or even one of
